## PART 1 — Minute-by-minute script

### 0:00–0:15 — Opening (YOU)
**Screen:** Project homepage

**Say:**
> Hi, we're Team Binary Rookies. This is a short demo of our anonymous, community-verified rumor system—where trust emerges without any central authority.

No long intro. Judges hate fluff.

---

### 0:15–0:45 — Anonymity (YOU)
**Show:** No login / no signup (identity gate or main screen)

**Say:**
> Notice there's no signup or identity required. Each user is assigned an anonymous identifier using a fingerprint and salt—no personal data is ever stored.

Pause for 1 second. Let them see it.

---

### 0:45–1:15 — Submitting a rumor (YOU)
**Action:** Submit a pre-planned rumor.

**Text example:** *The library will close early during finals week.*

**Say:**
> When a rumor is submitted, it starts with no trust. Credibility is earned only through community verification.

---

### 1:15–1:50 — Voting (VOICE HANDOFF or SAME SPEAKER)
**Show:** Voting buttons (True / False / Neutral)

**Say:**
> Anonymous users can vote once per rumor. But unlike polls, not all votes are equal.

**Action:** Switch to second account (incognito tab) for next part.

---

### 1:50–2:20 — Reputation impact (IMPORTANT)
**Show:**
- Vote from **new account** → small change
- Vote from **high-rep account** → larger change

**Say:**
> Users who've historically agreed with finalized outcomes carry more influence. So reputation is based on accuracy over time—not popularity.

This is the core value. Say it slowly.

---

### 2:20–2:45 — Stability & finalization
**Show:** Older rumor with **Finalized** badge and date

**Say:**
> After seven days, rumors finalize. Once finalized, scores can't be manipulated further—ensuring historical stability.

---

### 2:45–3:10 — Bot resistance (QUICK)
**Say:**
> Bot attacks are limited through CAPTCHA, rate limits, and low initial reputation—making coordinated manipulation mathematically ineffective.

Don't over-explain.

---

### 3:10–3:30 — Closing (YOU)
**Screen:** System overview / homepage (or “How it works” open)

**Say:**
> Instead of asking who controls truth, our system asks who has earned trust over time. Thank you.

End. No outro music. Clean cut.

## PART 2 — Recording checklist (before recording)

- [ ] Turn off notifications
- [ ] Close extra tabs
- [ ] Zoom browser to **110–125%**
- [ ] Dark mode ON (if available)
- [ ] **Cursor visible** (important)
- [ ] Backend and frontend running; app loads at http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Pre-write rumor in notepad: *The library will close early during finals week.* (paste into form at 0:45)
- [ ] Optional: create one older rumor in DB (or use seed) so you have something with a score to show voting + finalization

---

## PART 3 — Editing (minimal only)

**Use:** Clipchamp / CapCut / iMovie

**Do:**
- Trim dead silence
- Cut mistakes

**Do NOT:**
- Add music
- Add sound effects
- Add emojis or captions everywhere

This is a technical demo, not TikTok.
